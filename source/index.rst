Welcome to KDr2's Personal Website!
===================================================

Hi all, I'm KDr2(you might have seen this online alias ever before
somewhere), from Beijing, China. And this is a website detailing
things about me. I built this site with |sphinx|_, and I had put its
|rst|_ sources on |kd@github|_, you can get it freely if you want.

I'm a programmer, generally I do all of my developments with my laptop
(Lenovo ThinkpPad T400 2767 R38, and `this is a screenshot of it
<https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3039119/screenshot/screenshot-pub.png>`_),which
debian_ was installed on. I can write |erlang|_, C, C++, |python|_, Java,
Perl, Javascript and some more programming languages, And I am now devoting my
mind to the |linux|_, |erlang|_, and |python|_ studying.


What am I doing?
