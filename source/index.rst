Welcome to KDr2's Personal Website!
===================================================

Hi all, I'm KDr2(you might have seen this online alias ever before
somewhere), from Beijing, China. And this is a website detailing
things about me. I built this site with |sphinx|_, and I had put its
|rst|_ sources on |kd@github|_, you can get it freely if you want.

I'm a programmer, generally I do all of my developments with my laptop
(MBP MC724). I can write C/C++, |erlang|_, |ocaml|_, |cl|_, |python|_,
Java, Perl, Javascript and some more programming languages, And I am
now devoting my mind to the |linux|_, |python|_, |erlang|_, |lua|_, |cl|_ and
|ocaml|_ development on the server side.
