Welcome to KDr2's Personal Website!
===================================================

Hi all, I'm KDr2(you might have seen this online alias ever before
somewhere), from Beijing, China. And this is a website detailing
things about me. I built this site with `Sphinx
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_, and I had put its reStructuredText
sources on `GitHub <http://github.com/KDr2/kdr2.net>`_, you can get it
freely if you want.

I'm a programmer, generally I do all of my developments with my
laptop(HP Compaq Presario V3742TU[KG568PA]), which was installed
`Debian SID <http://www.debian.org>`_ on it. I can write Python,
Erlang, Perl, Ruby, C, C++, Java and some more programming languages.
You can see more about my IT skills and projects experience from
:ref:`my resume <resume>`.


Plan of the year 2010
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Improve my poor English.
 - Plant peanuts with `my wife <http://miss-understood.net>`_ and my
   parents at my hometown(Where I was born) in the coming spring.
 - A journey to New Zealand at the end of the fall(the start of next
   spring at the Southern Hemisphere).
